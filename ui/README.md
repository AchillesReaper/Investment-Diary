  Users must log every deposit, withdrawal, and trade order in the order they occurred. The system enforces this to maintain data integrity.

- **Trade Orders:**  
  When a trade order (buy or sell) is entered, the app automatically updates the portfolio’s positions and generates a matching cashflow entry.

  Users can review historical prices and portfolio performance over time, leveraging the app’s built-in data and reporting tools.
